Clean & Analyze Social Media

Introduction
Social media has become a ubiquitous part of modern life, with platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook serving as essential communication channels. Social media data sets are vast and complex, making analysis a challenging task for businesses and researchers alike. In this project, we explore a simulated social media, for example Tweets, data set to understand trends in likes across different categories.
